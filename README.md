# Rate-in , where all the movie stats collide
 This website is made to ease up the stress of finding something to watch by suggesting movies from differant genres and having a search feature to find all of the movie stats and info. The info displayed is the name, genres, a summery, the original title, some pictures and even a download link that takes the user to pirate bay and allows them to downloade it for free!


# Color Pallette Used:
 
 1. #121212(eerie black) for the background
 2. #E50914(Netflix Red) for some text, borders and button backgrounds
 3. #FFD700(Gold) for text, borders, logos spinners and alot more
 4. #ffffff(White) for text

 These colors create a cenimatic feel that fits perfectly with this website's theme.



# Inovations and New Things Done:

 1. Working with an API and specificaly the TMDB api that returns a list of 20 movie objects.
 2. Using Bootstarp spinners to load the movie images rather than make them pop out of nowere.
 3. Adding privacy polaci and terms of service in the footer which makes the website far more authentic
 4. Adding an a dynamic external link to pirate bay so the user is able to download the movie whatever it is from pirate bay
