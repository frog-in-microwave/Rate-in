# Inovations Added:

 1. the use of javascript and the type_effect function to create a typing effect in the hero section.
    it increments a variable with a letter one at a time, then deletes the word and rewrites it

 2. adding a contact section that is linked to my email. In the form of the contact section the action is set to a key provided by WPforms that handles everything once the form is submitted.
